# ReviewRestaurant

FINAL-STAGE is the updated branch.

A Google Maps map loaded with the Google Maps API. 
As soon as your location is found (Google Geolocation) a list of restaurants are displayed on the right side of the page, 
fetching data from API and displaying it to DOM. 
All the restaurants are stored into a global variable, 
in this way it is very easy to add a review about an existing restaurant and also add a restaurant 
by right-clicking on a specific place on the map. JavaScript Module Pattern has been used for this project, 
with very contained use of global variables.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Google, API
